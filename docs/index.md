## Installation

First, create and activate a Python virtual environment:

=== "Linux/macOS"

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```powershell
    py -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

Then install the `fact` package:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Quick Start

To use `fact` within your project, import the `factorial` function and execute it like:

```python
from fact.lib import factorial

# (1)
assert factorial(3) == 6
```

1. This assertion will be `True`

!!! tip

    Within PyCharm, use ++tab++ to auto-complete suggested imports while typing.
