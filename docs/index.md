    This user guide is purely an illustrative example that shows off several features of 
    [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and included Markdown
    extensions[^1].

[^1]: See `python-blueprint`'s `mkdocs.yml` for how to enable these features.

## Installation

First, [install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation):

=== "Linux/macOS"

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```powershell
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
    ```

Then install the `fact` package and its dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

Activate the virtual environment created automatically by Poetry:

```bash
poetry shell
```

## Quick Start

To use `fact` within your project, import the `factorial` function and execute it like:

```python
from fact.lib import factorial

assert factorial(3) == 6 # (1)!
```

1. This assertion will be `True`

!!! tip

    Within PyCharm, use ++tab++ to auto-complete suggested imports while typing.
