# Use a multi-stage build to reduce the size of the final image.
#   This example is optimized to reduce final image size rather than for simplicity.
# Using a -slim image also greatly reduces image size.
# It is possible to use -alpine images instead to further reduce image size, but this comes
# with several important caveats.
#   - Alpine images use MUSL rather than GLIBC (as used in the default Debian-based images).
#   - Most Python packages that require C code are tested against GLIBC, so there could be
#     subtle errors when using MUSL.
#   - These Python packages usually only provide binary wheels for GLIBC, so the packages
#     will need to be recompiled fully within the container images, increasing build times.
